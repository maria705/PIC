# Pharmaceutical-Image-Categorization

## Overview
Welcome to the PIC Project repository. This project is dedicated to developing a two-stage binary classifier for medical product images. Our goal is to not only detect images of medical products but also categorize them into specific classes such as blister packs, bottled medicine, prefilled syringes, and four other categories, totaling seven.

## Project Structure

### Stage One
In the first stage, our classifier aims to accurately determine whether an image includes a medical product.

### Stage Two
Once a medical product is detected, the second stage of the classifier categorizes the image into one of the seven specific classes of medical products.

## Previous Work

This project builds upon the discontinued SPICERS project. The files from SPICERS have been included in this repository for reference and as a foundation for further development.
